## Performance evaluation

* What are the common metrics to be defined and how can I evaluate those, with what tools ?
* How do I simulate a busy network, and a cyberattack ?

## Security evaluation

* What offensive tools to use ? What do I need to test ?

Enumeration
Install Kali Linux and then OpenVAS to check the network.

Denial of service attacks (something you can't really defend against. However you can minimize the impact by identifying the zombie machines from which the server is flodded with requests.)


Programs to epxplore:

Lynis - security auditing tool
Hwinfo and Ishw - provide info about the hardware
Htop - allow running processes and resources they use to be inspected

1. Reconaissance (Footprinting)
One of the security vulnerabilities that can be exploited at this levle would be to obtain the IP address. With this information it is possible to identify the geolocation of the target. Knowing this an attacked could place a device that can intercept the communications of this host with other systems and intercept the communication.


No protection against SQL injection. SQL is one of the most popular languages for querying a relational database. As the files are simply saved on the local system there is no need for a protection against such attacks. However, once a more robust storing solution is chosen and the files are saved in the database, we can sanitize the input and clean any SQL commands before saving the file.

Gaining access. Because this system is not meant for wide use the users can only authenticate with a RSA key. Even though this sacrifices convenience over security it is a much more secure way of transmitting files.

Denial of Service (DoS) is another attack that the system is exposed to. DoS attacks work by tacking control over a number of host machines (zombies) and by initiating a number of large requests from all the hosts at the same time. Any system can process a limited amount of resources. The zombies can request services from the server until they exhaust the machine. Essentially the DoS attack can be categorized as an availability attack.
